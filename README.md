# FASAI_API
“Web Scraping with Python” initiates the scraping of the captcha image src and uses base64 to convert src into image. After that we use OCR to extract the digit from the captcha image. We have used the selenium library for scraping and after decoding captcha from images we autofill the application number and captcha through API and all the result such as product detail are scraped and return the detail into JSON format
